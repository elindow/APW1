		10/23/21: Today I started a project with Shadab
		<br> 
		The Project is a Deep Learning Based Game where an AI should teach itself to play brickbreaker
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		10/29/21: This Week I worked on creating the Basics of the BrickBreaker Game Itself
		<br> 
		I am making the Code which will allow me to make custom Levels through text files. Shadab and I have made good progress with these developments.
		<br>

		11/04/21: This week Shadab and I continued our work on the project. I was able to get the program to read the LevelOne.txt file the correct way. I also learned how to <strong> bold <strong>

		11/12/21: This week I continued to work on my project and I also worked on learning how neural networks work for my teachback project. I will have working code which will demonstrate my knowledge of neural networks.

		12/3/21: This Week I continued my work on my project with shadab. We are still working on creating the game in an efficient manner before delving into the world of artificial intelligence. 
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		12/10/21: This week i worked with shadab on the basics of the game once again. We are getting much closer to a finished product.
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		12/17/21: This week i worked with shadab finalizing the basics and creating a plan for the break. We are going to try and have most of the basics done by the end of the break.

		1/20/22: Over the break shadab and I worked in the break and were working on making a full working game. We were able to get the basics of the game working. We have also decided to pause work on this project in favor of other pursuits. 
		<br> 
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		2/4/22: During the break Shadab and I looked into potential project ideas which will likely include art mixed with AI.
		<br> 
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		2/11/22: Over the past weeks I have been looking for a new project and am looking into image recognition and art applications along with shadab.

		2/18/22: At the moment I am starting work on two projects. For the first project I am working with Ben on a project which includes more engineering. The idea of the project is that It can determine if a person is focusing on a given task. (Details to come). The second project is with shadab and related to music. The project will likely take MIDI files and find peoples taste in music. Eventually the program could be expanded to create music people like rather than simpily finding it.

		&zwnj; 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		2/25/22:This Week I worked on a MIDI file Program. This program would both read, understand and display music. I am using the MIDO Library for this project
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p13>
	<p14 style ="background-color:gray; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">
		&zwnj; 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		3/4/22:This week I got the project to edit whole midi files. This allows me to change the key and octive of songs
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p14>
	<p15 style ="background-color:whitesmoke; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">
		&zwnj; 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		3/11/22: This week I decided to change the program so that I am able to modify individual tracks. This allows me to create an interesting effect
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p15>
	<p16 style ="background-color:gray; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		3/18/22: For this week I started on the process of transcribing the edited music. At the moment I am attempting to mark every note as its coresponding letter
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p16>
	<p17 style ="background-color:whitesmoke; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">
		&zwnj; 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		4/1/22: With this update I Assigned every note with a letter value and store them as Strings. I still do not know if they are perfectly alligned and am looking for a way to verify this
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p17>
	<p18 style ="background-color:gray; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		4/8/22: This week I was unable to put in meaningful work on this project as I was traveling the majority of the week
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p18>
	<p19 style ="background-color:whitesmoke; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">
		&zwnj; 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		4/15/22: This week I created a basic Midi file in order to test if my track lines up with the letter values for notes. I am continuing to tweak it until it is all correct.
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		4/22/22: This Week I started work on a side project. This mini project is a reaction tester I need for another class but it is a good experiment with html and Javascript compatability
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p20>
	<p21 style ="background-color:whitesmoke; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		4/29/22: This week I continued work on the reaction tester. I have now created the general framework for the project and am making steady progress
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p21>
	<p22 style ="background-color:whitesmoke; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">
		&zwnj; 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		5/6/22: This week I finished up the mini project. It now can test reactions and has modes to create sound and visuals smoothly
		<br> 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
	</p22>
	<p23 style ="background-color:whitesmoke; text-align:center; font-size: 17px;">
		&zwnj; 
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		5/13/22: This week I researched for my teachback presentation. I am additionally making a program that goes with my project.

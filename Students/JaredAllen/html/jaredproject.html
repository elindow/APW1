        <h1>Welcome to Jared's page. </h1>

        

<p><b>A) I changed the color of my web page from green to blue. </b></p>
    <p>B) First, I want to take a short course on html, css and javascript. Although I looked at the Odin Project, it seems a little long and extensive for my purposes. I am going to watch a tutorial on youtube for both html and css as well as javascript. After that I am going to make some more edits to my webpage because it is very basic and rudimentary right now because I don't know enough to change it. My first actual project will be coding a Tic Tac Toe game using python. </p>

    <p>Project Update: October 15, 2021 - I have been going through an html course on youtube. I already feel that I have learned a lot and feel much more comfortable with the language. <a href="HtmlCrashCourse.html">Here is the html page that I have been using to follow along with the course. </a> After the HTML and CSS tutorials I will make a robust visual and functional update to my pages. </p>

    <p>Project Update: October 22, 2021 - I have continued working on my html course and updating my practice html page as I follow along. Currently, I have run into an issue where the image is not appearing so I am working to resolve this issue. I should be finished with the html course sometime during this upcoming week. </p>

    <p>Project Update: October 28, 2021 - I finished the Html course that I was working on. In the final segment of the course I worked on creating complete websites and practiced using html semantics tags. I used <a href="blog.html"> this file</a> to practice these skills. Since I am now finished with the html course I will soon move on the the CSS course.</p>

    <p>Project Update: November 5, 2021 - I have started working on my CSS course.</p>

    <p>Project Update: December 3, 2021 - I worked on and finished my blockchain presentation. </p>

    <p> Project Update: January 28, 2021 - I finished my CSS course that I started before break and began creating a new and improved version of my website. </p>

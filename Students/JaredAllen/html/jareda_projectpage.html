	<h1>Project Updates</h1>

	<p>Project Update: October 15, 2021 - I have been going through an html course on youtube. I already feel that I have learned a lot and feel much more comfortable with the language. <a href="HtmlCrashCourse.html">Here is the html page that I have been using to follow along with the course. </a> After the HTML and CSS tutorials I will make a robust visual and functional update to my pages. </p>

    <p>Project Update: October 22, 2021 - I have continued working on my html course and updating my practice html page as I follow along. Currently, I have run into an issue where the image is not appearing so I am working to resolve this issue. I should be finished with the html course sometime during this upcoming week. </p>

    <p>Project Update: October 28, 2021 - I finished the Html course that I was working on. In the final segment of the course I worked on creating complete websites and practiced using html semantics tags. I used <a href="blog.html"> this file</a> to practice these skills. Since I am now finished with the html course I will soon move on the the CSS course.</p>

    <p>Project Update: November 5, 2021 - I have started working on my CSS course.</p>

    <p>Project Update: December 3, 2021 - I worked on and finished my blockchain presentation. </p>

    <p> Project Update: January 28, 2022 - I finished my CSS course that I started before break and began creating a new and improved version of my website. </p>

    <p>Project Update: Febuary 7, 2022 - Continued work on the new and improved version of my website. </p>

    <p>Project Update: Febuary  18, 2022 - Continued work on the new and improved version of my website.</p>

    <p>Project Update: Febuary  18, 2022 - Continued work on the new and improved version of my website. I expect to have a final product sometime towards the end of the week.</p>

    <p>Project Update: March 4, 2022 - I finally finished the new and improved version of my website. For the remaing time until the semester ends I will be working on an Arduino project as part of my engineering class. I hope to make a motion activated tripwire that will text me anytime it is triggered. So far I have created a functioning circuit that turns on a light when motion is sensed. My next steps are to program it to send a text message and then figure out how to actually install the gadget so it will stay attached to a doorframe/wall.<p>

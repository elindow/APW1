		<p> 1) 2/2/22: I am trying to recreate the Bitlife Prison Escape Game. </p>
		<p> 2) 2/11/22: I made it so that if you put the parameters in for the walls and the size of the prison, it creates the general layout for the prison (minus the exit). </p>
		<p> 3) 2/16/22: I made it so that it can sense where walls are or the spaces around (it's the beginning steps of making the characters move in each direction and stuff.)</p>
		<p> 4) 2/25/22: I made it so that the computer prison guard moves on it's own. It doesn't exactly move how it's supposed to so I have to fix that. </p>
		<p> 5) 3/4/22: I fixed it so that the prison guard moves properly, added the exit, and game over function. Now all I need to do is finish up the final aesthetic touches (including putting actual avatars instead of circles), and testing other prison setups -- making sure everything works properly. </p>
		<p> 6) 3/11/22: I have been super busy this last week of break with the practice ACTS, 3 assessments, a bunch of projects and my birthday, so as of now at least I haven't changed anything and I probably won't by Friday. This project though, should be done the next update or two.
		<p> 7) 4/1/22: I made the code way more efficient and made it so that different layout puzzles work. I just need to make the game stop when you win or lose and replace the circles with character pictures (also I should add more layouts). So far it seems that the game works the way it's supposed to though. </p>
		<p> 8) 4/8/22: Sorry, I couldn't do anything. This week has been super hectic. </p>
		<p> 9) 4/15/22: I cropped images of both characters (cop and inmate) and put text above explaining the object of the game. I intend (as the last touch) to add reset and level navigation, a long with more layout set ups. However, the game is technically complete and to my knowledge works fine.
		<p> 10) 4/22/22: My computer broke. </p>
		<p> 11) 4/29/22: Still waiting on that computer. </p>

		<p> 12) 5/6/22: Additional issue was detected. Still waiting. </p>
		<p> 13) 5/13/22: I decided I'm done with my current project and I'm figuring out what I want to do next </p>

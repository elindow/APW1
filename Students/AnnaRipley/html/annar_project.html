		<p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>My Project:</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 20px;">At the end of last year Asher and I worked on our final project together. We did not get to finish it, so we hope to finish it this year. Our plan for last year was to be able to have our computers recognize our faces. With that information we then wanted the computer to to shut down when any other face, besides our own, came into the frame. By the end of the year we were able to get my computer to identify my face. Asher ran into a couple problems because we are working off of different computers so he did not get his to work. This year we hope to complete our initial idea and get Asher&apos;s computer to work the same as mine.</span></p>

		<p><b>10/22 Update:</b> In order to make the face recognition a little more secure I thought of finding ways to recognize my eyes and smile so it's not as ambiguous. I noticed when I was showing Mr.Lindow my project in class that it recognized my face even with the fask, so that makes the program way less secure. I found new code to attempt this but I don't have it functioning completely. Also instead of working to completely shut off the computer when it sees another face it might be smarter and more simple to just have a picture cover up the screen. We will make it so that no one is able to get rid of the picture (more of else the screen will be frozen) unless they press specific keys which only I will know. It seems way more unlikely that we will be able to completely override the software of the computer to simply shut it off. This new idea might be a little smarter. </p>

		<p><b> 10/28 Update:</b> This week we had a bit of a slow start. Asher was not available much this week to work because of college applications and our main focus was getting his computer to work, running our original program. I was able to get a black image show up which we are going to have display when an unknown face enters the screen. For now the black image shows up when I press the key 'a' because before it was stuck in a loop, so now that is fixed. Unfortunately there is a border on the image and a border on Python images in general. I tried to find a way to get rid of it and I found some type of code that I have working but it didn't work to get rid of the border. I will continue to try to remove the border but I also might just try to expand the image a lot so that the Python border doesn't show up at all. Not sure if that will work but I'll keep you updated!! </p>

		

		<p><strong>11/5 Update:</strong> Asher and I decided that we really wanted to make the program work to completely shut off the computer instead of doing the black screen. However, we tried both. Asher got the black screen working on his computer in a previous project he did, so we tried it on mine and ran into errors that did not necessarily make sense. We also found out that it&apos;s much easier to shut down a PC than it is a Mac. On a Mac you cannot use the command to shut off the computer in PyCharm. We tried it in the normal terminal, using the same command, and it worked. Our next goal is to get the terminal synced up with PyCharm so that they can work together to shut off the computer. Once we figure that out we will also try to make the face recognition a little bit more secure (maybe using eyes). So if a person who looks like me comes in the frame with a mask on the program does not get confused.&nbsp;</p>


		<p><strong>11/12 Update:</strong> Although it may not seem like it, I feel as though we made some pretty good steps forward this week. We figured out code that works directly in PyCharm to shut the computer off when the program runs. We also were able to work it into our project to shut off when my face is detected in the camera (obviously it will not be like this in the end but it is easier to have now to test everything out so that we do not need a random face in the frame to have stuff work). We did run into a couple issues of course. One is that when we run the program and it is about to shut it off it displays the box that Apple always shows when you shut down your computer (image is below). The other issue is that for that piece of the code to even run, the camera has to detect my face and then I have to quit out of the camera for the next part (the shutting off) to even begin. We need to figure out how to have the two happen simultaneously. We think it has something to do with some sort of loop going on in the original code but we couldn&apos;t find a way around it yet.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>11/19 Update:</strong> We got a lot done this week! First we used &apos;pyautogui&apos; to allow the program to take control of the mouse. This solved our problem of the warning that Apple gives you when your computer is about to shut off. We now have the mouse working to move to the button that says &quot;Shut Down&quot; and has it press it when the program runs. We also have the program working without the camera and when it sees my face, instead of me having to press &apos;q&apos; to quit out of the program, it automatically goes to the mouse code to shut off the computer. The issue now is that we currently only have it working with my face. I tried with my mom&apos;s face and it didn&apos;t work well. I think that should be an easy fix though. The other issue is that we were practicing with the &quot;Cancel&quot; button instead of the &quot;Shutdown&quot; button so that I didn&apos;t have to constantly keep turning on my computer, but when I switched the mouse position to the &quot;Shut Down&quot; button it didn&apos;t work as well. Pycharm gives you a lot of warnings and won&apos;t shut the computer down until you accept that Pycharm is going to quit. Both of these problems seem like pretty quick fixes though, so hopefully we will get those done next week.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>12/2 Update:</strong> This week was a success. We basically have it working. We have it working very well with my face, which we are using just to test it. When the computer sees my face it shutdowns. I then tested it out with random people in school and it did not work 100% of the time. I think it may be issues with our &quot;Unknown&quot; variable. For unknown we used a picture of Asher&apos;s face. So the program works when it sees Asher&apos;s face because that is what is unknown. To solve this problem we are either going to have to add in a bunch of random photos of people that would have access to our computer, or find a new way to identify what is Unknown.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>12/10 Update:</strong> There honestly was not much progress this week. We both had very busy weeks and we did not have that much time to sit down and fix our problem. We attempted, but we realized that it is going to take a lot more time and work than we thought. Although we seem to be really close, I think we took a bit of a short cut last year and now we are unfortunately paying for it... Hopefully we will be able to a get a bit done next week before break.&#128151;</p>


		<p><strong>12/17 Update:</strong> &#128159;&#128159;&#128159;We attempted to find a solution to our problem. Basically, because we had it working for my face we thought that by saying "if name != known_face_names[0]:" it would begin to work for other people's faces. This unfortunately did not work. But theoretically I still think it should. Mr.Golanka, if you're seeing this, maybe you might have an idea because I know last year we did a lot of work with if statements and while statements. Also after break it might be smart to do a debug log or print statements(Mr.Lindow's idea) saying what is happening at each step as the camera is running because right now the actual live video does not appear and it is hard to know what it is doing behind the screen. <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><em><strong>SEE YOU AFTER BREAK!!</strong></em></span>&#128159;&#128159;&#128159;</p>

		<p><strong>1/27 Update:</strong> In terms of the project I&apos;m doing with Asher we have not done a lot recently. We&apos;re thinking of starting a new project but I really want to finish this one... For a couple weeks I&apos;ve just been playing around with my page: adding emojis, changing some stuff in the tab, etc.). Next week Asher and I will get back into our project issues.</p>

		<p><strong>2/4 Update:</strong> This week Asher and I have come to a sad conclusion😔... We have decided to stop working on this project and have deemed the project unfixable. I think last year we got a little ahead of ourselves and did too many steps too quickly which ended up not working in our favor down the road. We have decided that we will come up with a small fun project for the remainder of this semester to work on! </p>

		<p><strong>2/11 Update:</strong> I have been trying to come up with a new project idea this week. I feel like I don't necessarily have time to begin a new big project because I don't have much school left. For the rest of this year I might just learn and teach myself more about HTML and making my own website from scratch. I would love to make my pages more interesting. I know Charlotte is doing a project slightly similar, so I will talk with her a little bit about it and figure out a good plan for myself!!</p>

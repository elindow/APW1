      <p> For my contribution to the class website project, I added an image that I found online of someone holding a book infront of mountains. What I learned from doing this was how to add an image that I found online to my website. I feel like this is a good foundation for what I want to do for my project. What I have in mind is to make some sort of interactive image where browsers can draw whatever they want on a canvass that I put on the website. I'm not entirely sure how I will do this but I feel like if I can add an image of a plain white screen and have some function where people can interact with it, I can do it. </p> 
      <p> 10/29 Update: For this week's update, I started to download images from the internet that I will use for my project. I also started some of the basic classes.</p>
      <p>11/5 Update: For this week's update, I made a function where moving the mouse while it is being held down will draw. The color of the 'paint' is red but I am working towards making buttons that change the color as well as a button that erases whatever has been drawn.</p>
      <p>11/12 Update: For this week's update, I started a button class that will make it so cliking on different colors will change the color of the brush's ink.</p>
      <p> 11/19 Update: I continued to work on the button class that will change the paint color</p>
      <p> 12/3 Update: I had a lot of major assignments due this week and didn't get the chance to do a lot of work on the project</p>

<h1>Owen's Midterm Reflection</h1>
<p>Building a web page was an excellent introduction to html/css/js and collaborative Github work. For my webpage, I focused on learning specific tasks that I did not understand: embedding webpages in other webpages and playing audio recordings online. In order to create a cohesive website, I chose to make it about someone I knew would compellingly combine audio and text: Alexander Hamilton. For the audio portion of my website, I dowloaded "Alexander Hamilton" from the musical Hamilton and converted it to mp3. After uploading the audio to the website in html, I used javascript to create play and pause buttons. For the second part of my webpage, I used an inline frame ("<iframe>") to embed the Alexander Hamilton Wikipedia page. I'm now working on a project to change the background of this webpage.

Going forward, I intend to focus on learning Python 3 this semester. I will do this by reading "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. As I'm reading this, I will apply my learning by using Python to analyze national education data (exact source to be determined).

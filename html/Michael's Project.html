         <p>I am currently taking a course on the basics of C#. I want to learn this language because I find the applications of it quite interesting.</p>
         <p>I plan to update this page as I progress throughout the course.</p>
         <p>Next semester I plan on using the knowledge I have gained from the course to make some programs/plugins for games as I think it could be pretty cool. There is also a possibility that I might be working with Ozan on a Unity project.</p>

      	<p>
      	My project this semester was taking a C# fundamentals course. The course consisted of 11 sections, each with their own subtopics going into specific ideas with great detail. The sections included .NET framework, Primitive Types and Expressions, Non-Primitive Types, Controlling Flow, Arrays and Lists, Date and Time, Text Files, and Debugging Programs. What I enjoyed most about this course was the instructor’s exceptional ability to demonstrate how different functions work. I also found this course helpful because there were all kinds of exercises and quizzes at the end of each section/lesson. 
      </p>
      <p>One topic I found interesting in this course was the use of classes. Specifically, I thought the use of Enumeration type classes was very handy because it has the power to assign names to a group of integer values, making a program more organized. I feel that I can now look at a C# program and understand rudimentarily what is going on, and potentially even debug it. Some of the basic ideas, such as arrays, lists, and functions were somewhat easy to understand because of my previous years of programming. However, the use of date and time was a bit confusing for me and definitely took the most time to learn about.</p>
      <p>Additionally, this course introduced me to Visual Studio, which I find quite intuitive. With the knowledge I gained from the course and the use of this software, I think that next semester I could begin to build programs, possibly even plugins for games. I think this would be an interesting task to take on because it would test my ability to apply what I learned in this course.

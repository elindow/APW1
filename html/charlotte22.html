<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">For the class website project, I edited the style.css files for the main programming website. I adjusted the colors and fonts and commented out what the programming lines did on the page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-size: medium; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; "><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">For my next project, I want to focus on the basics of coding, so I will explore the Khan Academy and Odin program and see which works best for me.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong> 10/22/21 Update:</strong> I decided to start with the html/css Khan Academy programs, and have been working my way through the intro to html--I'm about 80% through this portion and am already finding myself integrating the material into my webpage. &nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong> 10/29/21 Update:</strong> I have finished the entire Intro to HTML section, mostly watching videos and practicing examples. I am at the beginning of Intro to CSS. Some cool things I have learned are how to write in bold and italics, how to add headings (there are different tiers), how to add paragraphs, how to make regular and ordered lists, and a little bit on how to add images, which I will soon use for my own page. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong> 11/5/21 Update:</strong> I am currently working on how to add images onto a page. Using what I learned from the basics of html, I cleaned up the code on my webpage. I also did my teachback on what I learned from html and it seemed to be helpful for the rest of the class. I am about 25% through the Intro to CSS. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong> 11/12/21 Update:</strong> I was away for a bit due to extenuating circumstances, so I wasn't able to do much work. I did however get through a good amount of the Intro to CSS.  &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong> 11/19/21 Update:</strong> I have been working through using style tags. Right now I am learning how to change the background color of a webpage and the background color of a paragraph. I am in the middle of one of the challenges and it seems like I did everything right but it won't let me move on to the next step. I will do some trouble-shooting and see if I can fix it. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong> 12/3/21 Update:</strong> I worked through the issue on the CSS project, and have learned how to add color to headings and paragraphs with their corresponding tag names. I have been helping peers in editing their own webpages with what I have learned which has been really cool to see how my work applies. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong> 12/10/21 Update:</strong> I want to start applying the <em> things</em> I have learned to my <em> <strong> page.</strong> </em> 

<ol>
<li> Here is an ordered list</li>
<li> Ordered lists are slightly different than regular lists</li>
<li> They are helpful because they automatically number it for you!</li>

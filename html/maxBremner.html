	<h1>Welcome to Max "The Webmaster" Bremner's page. The Webmaster is an amazing word.</h1>
	<p> So, about having an interesting website. I couldn't think about what I wanted to do. I had some very big ideas but the idea of writing them in HTML, a language I haven't yet learned, scared the bejeezus out of me.</p>

	<h2> or use the stylesheet in a cool way <h2>

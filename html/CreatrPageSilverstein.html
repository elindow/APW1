		<h2>Welcome to Archie's Project Page</h2>
		<h4>As a first-year student in advanced Programming I wasn't assigned any work on the main project's page. I learned some HTML from doing all of this</h4>
		<h4>The project Jacob and I will be working on is called Creatr:  Creatr will be an online platform for long-distance collaboration, with a built-in project management system and educational resources. You might be thinking about all the things that Creatr is similar to. Github? Topcoder? Maybe Instructables? The truth is, nobody has made anything quite like Creatr, a platform not just for sharing projects, but for making them. From its inception, each project on our site comes with achievable milestones, from which the project manager can measure the growth of the project.</h4>

		<li>I started doing my project by familiarizing myself with HTML. I did so by taking four codecademy Exercises in HTML. I stopped taking the courses because I felt confident enough in my knowledge of the program to get myself started on my project.</li>
		<h4 id="dates">12/18/20</h4>
		<li>At this point I was fairly busy writing my college supplements. I had not heard back from my Early Decision school yet and I was writing my Regular Decision Supplements, preparing for the winter break work that (thankfully) I didn't have to finish. Once again, I'm sorry for not completing the assignment when it was due.</li>

		<h4 id="dates">1/8/21</h4>
		<li>Recently, I have been following a tutorial from an incredible coder who is building a mock version of Facebook called myBook. The subjects and concepts that he's been covering are exactly the kind of aspects I need to know for Jacob and my project. I am currently working my way throughg his tutorials. I am roughly a quarter or third of the way through his lengthy tutorial (here is the link if you would like to check it out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOhsHkMaKQ&list=PLY3j36HMSHNWaKUC73RJlwi6oU-WTpTPM&index=1&ab_channel=QuickProgramming" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">Social Website From Scratch</a>. It's teaching me a lot of good HTML, and it recently started teaching me about XAMPP. I have worked a bit on my main project, but I'm still building up the tools to do so in an effective way, and I project to be done with the tutorial very soon.

		<li>I worked through more of the tutorial mentioned above</li>

		<h3 id="dates">Semester Update: 1/22/21</h3>
		<br>
		<li>This term has primarily been a learning semester for me. I started this year learning the ropes of HTML on Codecademy, and it was with this preliminary knowledge that I coded my starter page for the year. While I was working on my starter page, I learned about Github and Sublime. Prior to this, I had been using the application Atom, but after, I switched to using Sublime full time. I have since taken PHP and CSS courses on Codecademy. I appreciated how CSS paired so nicely with HTML, and how PHP was a bit more familiar to Processing in terms of syntax. After I had gained the necessary knowledge to feel comfortable writing and understanding website code, I looked for video tutorials on YouTube, similar to the project that Jacob and I had sought out to do: to create a social platform, in which people could post coding projects and recruit other technologically affluent people to help them. I stumbled upon a video series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeOhsHkMaKQ&list=PLY3j36HMSHNWaKUC73RJlwi6oU-WTpTPM&index=1&ab_channel=QuickProgramming" target="_blank" rel="noopener nonreferrer">Social Website From Scratch</a>, that was very helpful in my mission of learning how a social site works. I have learned more HTML and PHP from this tutorial, in addition to learning about the importance and implementation of databases on social sites. This tutorial taught me how to use XAMPP, and how to store data from a website. My goal this semester was not to finish Jacob and my project, Creatr. I'm aware that social sites take a while to complete. My goal this semester was to learn enough to understand how everything works, so that I may effectively work more on the project in the second semester. I am confident that now with the college process finished, I will have more time to working on Creatr, and I hope that I am able to help Jacob bring the project to fruition. Thank you for being so patient with me this past semester, and I am very excited to continue working on the project in the coming months!</li>

		<h4 id="dates">2/5/21</h4>
		<li>In the past week I have worked more on the tutorial, a bit more on the website design, and I have done some research into different softwares that I could be using over my Bridge project. I plan to keep working on Creatr over my Bridge project, but (in a bit of personal news) I interviewed for an internship at a company called Toolio, and I got the internship! I'm going to be meeting with the CEO later today detailing what the specifics of my job are going to be. I am going to be the intern for the Business Development Associate, and I'm really excited to learn about the foundational stages of an emerging tech start-up. To be clear, I plan to keep working on Creatr in the second semester, and during my Bridge project as well, and I'm super excited about it!</li>
		<br>
		<h4 id="dates">2/12/21</h4>
		<li>In the past week I got the internship job at Toolio! I'm very excited about it. For the job and for Creatr, I have started learning Django this week and I am very excited about it. I can't wait! Have a great long weekend!</li>
		<br>
		<h4 id="dates">2/26/21</h4>
		<li>This week I learned more Django and I have been trying to trouble-shoot a problem I having with the Creatr code. I am trying to register accounts, however there seems to be a bug and my database is not recording the registration. I hope to solve this problem in the coming days. Have a great day!</li>

	I began this semester by learning the script writing software Final Draft. It is the industry standard software and is extremely helpful in not only learning the craft of screenwriting, but also accessing your creativity. It allows you to map out your story across virtual note cards, story boards, and take a step back and look scene by scene. I had a lot of fun learning this software and was actually able to use it to write some of my college supplements. In addition to learning this software, I have taken the lead on my Environmental History class’s website about rivers. It is a Wordpress site that I am working on both the back and front end of and am collaborating with Mr. Golanka as well. I have done some html work as well as learning the Wordpress interface and plugins. I have had a really great time during this first semester.

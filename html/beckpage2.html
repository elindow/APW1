My webpage had many different features to it. It had some embeded code like a weather app and a pinball game. It also had a picture of Kadhir. I made a program on Processing and wanted to put it on my website. I had to convert the code to JavaScript, so I used an online converter. It didn't convert everything, so I had to manually change some code. I had trouble with the code because it was 3D. I had issues with lighting.

  <h1> My name is Daniel Lewis and this is what I'm going to do for my project</h1>

<p style="background-blend-mode: color-burn;" style="text-align:center;">
For my independent project, I am going to work on Brilliant courses, and hopefully give a teachback on what I've learned. First I am going to start with Logic courses 1, 2 and then Joy of Problem solving. I think that these will be useful for coding, helping me look at programming more logically, and giving myself the courage to problem solve when hit with a road block. I will take that knowledge into actual programming courses such as, Computer Science Fundamentals, Algorithm Fundamentals and Programming with Python. If complete all of these and have time for a second project, I would like to learn website design. Will add more details when I come closer to it.

<h3>Another logic puzzle for you to solve.</h3>
<h4>Rules become a bit more complex</h4>
<h5>Futoshiki is a board-based puzzle game, also known under the name Unequal. It is playable on a square board having a given fixed size (5x5 for example).

The purpose of the game is to discover the digits hidden inside the board's cells; each cell is filled with a digit between 1 and the board's size. On each row and column each digit appears exactly once; therefore, when revealed, the digits of the board form a so-called Latin square.

At the beginning of the game some digits might be revealed. The board might also contain some inequalities between the board cells; these inequalities must be respected and can be used as clues in order to discover the remaining hidden digits.

Each puzzle is guaranteed to have a solution(still figuring out if it's only 1 solution). Draw this one out on a piece of paper. *Hint* Stay organized</h5>

<h1> Semester Update</h1>




<h3> Documentation of project </h3>
<p>
Although I was unsure of where to start in the beginning, these brilliant courses have been incredible for me to expand my understanding of logic, and help me know that even when I can't figure something out, or something seems impossible, there is always a solution and a way to get there. My project has consisted of Logic course 1 on Brilliant. I have documented my progress through demonstated understanding of logic in the teachback presentation and by posting certain logic problems on my website that I found very interesting. </p>

<h3> Effort applied to completion of project</h3>
<p>
	Although I belive that I applied a lot of effort to my project, I had some set backs when I was unable to access my brilliant account. As of now I am 1/3 done with the first logic course, and although it doesn't sound like much, it is a very long course and a lot of the problems like the Futoshiki one that I have shown above, can take me up to fourty minutes for a single problem which is why I am still so impressed that Mr. Golanka got it in less than 5.) , and even just 1 lesson(there are 38 lesson) can consist of 10-15 problems. I am working my way through it and would like to finish soon so I can start on actual programming. </p>

<h3>Difficulty level of project</h3>
<p>
	The difficulty of my project I believe would range from a 6-7. Although the problems that I face in the course are quite challenging, I have not dived into any real programming besides for building this website. By the end of the year I want to be able to have java script code on one of my pages and figure out a path I want to take for possibly bridge, over the summer and college. This has been a great opportunity for me to expand my understanding of all types of programming and how many paths there are to take when wanting to learn code.

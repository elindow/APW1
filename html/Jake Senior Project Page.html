			<h7> 11/19/2020: I have been experimenting with VBA in excel. I have learned the basics on how to set up a module and create macros.</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 12/9/2020: I have writen some code for my ardino and now I am just waiting for my cables to arrive from amazon so I can attach the servo. I did test the ardino and got the blinking light to work. I also have been working on my teachback presentation and have been creating some VBA explains to explain why VBA is just a bad language</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 12/16/2020: This entire week was spent preparing a presentation for my teachback. I made a couple examples for class and wrote a general outline for a script.</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 1/7/2021: This is my first project using ardinos so I have been trying to do some background research to understand all the parts. Today in class I watched a series of youtube videos on the each part of the board and how each peice can be used. Honestly, it has been very helpful because even though I worked with a raspberry pi last year up to this point I have not understood the parts of the hardware.</h7>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h7> 1/15/2021: This week I wrote some code that is supposed to make my servos spin at certain intervals but this week was challenging because I left my hardware in Massachusetts. I created several snipets that should make the servo spin at certain intervals so that when I hook a stylus it will run the macro on my screen probably. It will probaly have to be tweaked but that is a next week project.</h7>

			<h7>Final 1st Semester Thing:I started the semester with a goal to learn VBA because I was taking statistics this year. I wanted to learn every trick Microsoft Excel had to offer. After spending the first couple of weeks watching youtube videos and playing around with basic buttons and message boxes I decided to delve more deeply into the complexities of message boxes. I very quickly learned that as more content was added to the boxes the syntax of the original content had to be changed. At this point I learned that VBA was rated the most dreaded coding language and I knew exactly why. The complexities of the syntax slowed my progress for a bit because I kept getting stuck as a result of extra parentheses, commas, etc. After I had a satisfactory knowledge of the message boxes I started mimicking built in excel functions such as sum, average, min, max, etc. The challenge here rose from the web of selection functions that VBA has to offer. For example you can make a regular selection, then run a sum function and have the result replace your selection. Alternatively you can hardcode the result into a specific cell. Most interesting to me however was to get the results of sum, min, max, average, etc into a list that was offset below the data which was surprisingly difficult. To do this you need an offset selection with a for loop that moves the output cell down, up, left, or right depending on the location of the selection. It was around this point where I got very frustrated with VBA and quit the application several times without saving my work (a rage quit if you will). This was when I decided to look into another project. </h7>

			<h7>       I wanted to work with hardware and after speaking with Mr. Lindow decided to purchase some arduinos and servos. My goal for the arduinos and servos is to create a setup that allows me to abuse a time exploit in a game called Egg inc. By using the servos with styluses attached to them I can physically control finger strokes on my screen and accomplish this task. I plan on conducting my first test of my code next week and I imagine the timing will need some work. I know that this is definitely not the most efficient way to go about creating a macro but I thought it would be cool to turn a traditionally software based project of creating macros into a hardware based one. </h7><br>
			<br>
			<h7> 2/4/2021: For my second semester project I am continuing to work with mini ardinos though I am still trying to figure out what I want to do specifically because I ran into a small problem during the last week. Over the past 2 weeks I have succesfully made my servo spin. I also was able to disassemble and connect the head of a stylus to the servo. Unfortunatly, the servo does not provide enough pressure to affect my phone screen which poses a problem. At this point I can either figure out something else to do, build a larger contraption that can apply more pressure or buy a bigger servo. I plan on discussing this with Mr. Lindow or Mr. Golonka in class next week.</h7>

		My plans for the year:
	</h3>
	<p>
			I am excited for the upcoming year. I hope to learn html using Codecademy and make an app. Last year for my final project, I made a dictionary. Originally, I wanted to make a program that allowed the user to communicate with the computer through a chat. The user would type in something, and the computer would respond. The goal of this was so that people would be able to practice learning a new language if they did not have someone at home speaking to them. This year I plan to take my work from last year and build on it. I want to accomplish my original goal and hope to make the project into an app.

		I was trying to do a part of the Codecademy course but it wouldn't let me press next. I checked my work alongside what it was asking me to do, but I couldn't find what I was doing wrong.

	I learned a lot so far! I can now add links to other pages and make them open in a new window using targets and anchors. I learned how to use images as a link too. I want to learn how to use make the images I have locally on my computer links too which is my next step. I currently have the link to get back to my main page as a text link which I want to change. I'm going to email Mr. Golanka and see if he knows how to do that so my part of the website fits my style more. I also don't like how the font looks either so I'm going learn how to change the font. I think it would be cool to change the entire background color as well as the color of my text (I want to make the text white).

	January 20th, 2020: Semester Update
	</h5>
	<p>
	I'm trying to completly finish the HTML course on Codecademy by the end of this week. I want to take what I learned from the HTML course and apply it to my current part of the website.

	I also talked to Mr. Lindow and I am planning on talking a css course for the next part of my project. I will also be talkig this course on Codecademy. I want to make my part of the website look better becuase I care a lot about the aesthetics of it. I plan to add to my website as I go. 

	When I finish the CSS course (probably by mid February), I will start doing the project I worked on last year. Essentially, I will be trying to make a translator that will have a conversation (most likey through text) with the user. This project will be what I work on for the rest of the term.

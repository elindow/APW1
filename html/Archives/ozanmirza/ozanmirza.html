										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I'm a 10th grader at Trevor Day School and I am taking both the Advanced Programmer's Workshop and I'm also a TA in an Intermediate Computer Programming Class. I've been teaching myself programming ever since the age of 11. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Java, Objective-C, Swift, and C#. I also have 5 apps on the iOS AppStore, 2 apps on the Mac OS X AppStore, and 2 apps on the Google Play Store.</p>

												<h3>Charity Finder</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This is a website that lets the user search for a Charity through it's finances. The way it works is where the user fills out a series of prefrences presented to them, and then the website sends that data to the GuideStar data center, which returns a list of matching charities, and provides a whole profile of the charity aswell. The agreement between the service and the website ceased, so now the data is not available anymore.</p>

												<h3>Objective-C Teachback</h3>

											<p>This is the second project of the first semester where each student spends a class period presenting and teaching a programming concept to the other students. I chose mine to be the Objectivce-C language. It starts off with a presentation of the history of Objective-C and what it's used for, and then moves on into a website I create the let's the user learn the basic syntax of Objective-C.</p>

												<h3>Sleek Weather</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For my next project, I decided to learn a new technology for app building called Flutter. It uses the language Dart and creates cross-platform apps for both Android and iOS. To teach myself the Objects from the API I decided to make a simple app: weather. I used two free weather APIs OpenWeatherMap and DarkSky. I also used the Google Maps API for location lookup. At the beginning of the project I knew nothing about Flutter, know I am well-versed in it.</p>

											<p>Dr. Henry gave me a copy of her AI Chess Game and told me to hack-away with it. And that is exactly what I did: this is a cross-platform desktop app built with Electron and Java for the Mac, Windows, and Linux OSs. It is a 6-leveled chess game app where the user plays against an AI. The game is developed by Dr. Henry and coded in Java and the homepage is built with Node JS (Electron).</p>

												<h3>God's Eye</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For my final project, I decided to takle something that I have been wanting to try since forever. I am creating a backtesting GUI software that lets users check if their algorithims will work in the stock market. It is built on Cocoa (only runnable on Mac) with C# in Visual Studio. The main window also shows today's top headlines and lets the user change it to whichever source they want to.</p>

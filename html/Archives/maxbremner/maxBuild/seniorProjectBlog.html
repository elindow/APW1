	<h1> Welcome to my Senior Project Webpage! <h1>
	<p1> This page will be used to track progress and show off my advanced programmers workshop coding project. So far I have created a thermodynamics physics calculator. This can take different points' pressure and volume and show the change in internal energy, heat in or out, and work done by the engine. 

		<br> <br>

		Step 1.
	The first step in creating my calculator was to learn how to do the arithmatic behind the equations in swift. Swift is an interesting language, it is the language that Apple created and is croudsourced meaning that the public helps in the creation and updates of swift. Swift gives iOS developers the oppurtunity to develop apps with that sleek apple look that has taken over the world of mobile technology. 

	<br> <br>

		Step 2.
	The variables I programmed: internal energy (U), heat gained or lost (Q), and work done by the engine (Wby) had to be tested with one point first. After these initial tests I changed the program so it has 3 data points and calculates the change in each of these variables for each step of a thermodynamic cycle. <p1>

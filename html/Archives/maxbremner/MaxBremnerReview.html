<h1>Max Bremner: in Review,</h1>

<p>I added a website that I would describe as an interactive peice of art. It is based on the premise that I couldn't decide on what I wanted to create. I was spending so much time trying to decide that I realized I should create something based on that. I created a website that covers the three languages that were requiered (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) while talking about how much I couldn't decide on what to do. </p>
<p1> Next I think I will relearn swift and try to create and iPhone app. In the summer before sophmore year (2017) I did a two week coding intensive in the language of swift, apples language that is used to create most iPhone apps. I really enjoyed it and it motivated me to learn more about coding. I would like to this language partially because I hope that I can capture that same interest and motivation. I also enjoyed making programs that could be applied in real life. There were also many ways to incorporate interesting and modern styles, a luxury that is usually reserved for proffessionals. </p1>

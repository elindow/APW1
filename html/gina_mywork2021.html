      <p> <strong> Journal 1: Wesbite </strong><br>

        February 5th, 2021 <br><br>
		    Currently, I am in the process of deciding my semester project. I still haven't found much inspiration for what I want to work on. While figuring that out, I have been working on my website. I have added a footer, navigation bar, and I am hoping to add a slide show of images at the top. Something that I find difficult is organizing my html code and each parts' css attributes. I began with a rough sketch of what I hoped to achieve, which it is often more difficult to bring to life once it comes to the coding.

      <p> <strong> Journal 2: Possible Project? <br>
        </strong> February 21st, 2021 <br><br>
        I talked to Dr. Henry about my ideas for a coding project and she happened to be giving a presentation to teachers on implementing programming into other classes. In her physics class, we often use code to model real life experiments, which has been especially useful during Covid. I think going virtual has pushes other classes to use more virtual and online resources. <br>

        Though I was considering finishing a game I started a very long time ago, lately I've been leaning towards more useful and practical projects. Dr. Henry suggested that I talk to Mr. Chang, who attended her presentation, about writing a progrom for our math department. After talking to him, I think that a Math related, virtual simulation program would be possible. And could be implemented into Trevor math classes.

      <p> <strong> Journal 3: Website Work <br>
        </strong> March 3th, 2021 <br><br>
        So far the website has been going well and I really enjoy learning more about html and css. I feel fairly comfortable with both, but I am stikk working on efficency. Something I want to learn more about is javascript. I really want to create a stronger website, so part of this semester will be spent taking Javascript classes on codeacademy. <br>

        I've tried to add the slideshow I was talking about earlier, but I think I need to learn more about javascript to better understand how to implement one. I really like using fitted columns and boxes to organize my webpage with css, but I have a hard time getting them to look exactly as I envisons. Especially with specfic locations that stray from pre-set qualities. I've added the css for my journal entries includeding the boxes, shadows, and the overall spacing. I also struggled with the navagation bar a bit because I wanted my name to also be apart of the navagation bar, but not with the same attributes as the actual page options.

      <p> <strong> Journal 4: Website Work & Classes <br>
        </strong> March 8th, 2021 <br><br>
        Next year I plan on starting a club called Project Outreach and I have been working on the webiste that will go along with the club. The website is meant to make community service options more avalible to young adults, who are oftentimes too young to qualify for certain jobs. I plan on adding a search engine, but so far a few organizations are listed.<br>

        Meanwhile, I have the outline of my slideshow code, I just need to add the images and adjust the location. The slide show is slightly hovering over the navagation bar, and I haven't been able to move it down. <br>

        I also decided to take a codecademy course (that I mentioned earlier) on Javascript. So far it is going well, but I  sometimes get the syntax and style of different languages confused. Especially if I haven't coded in that language for a while.  <br>

        I am kind of sad to leave APCS behind, so I am planning on restarting the course either this year or next year to take the AP test.

        This is the <a href="https://project-outreach.glitch.me/">Project Outreach Website</a> I have been working on for the past while, I am going to work on adding more service options and creating the search engine I mentioned earlier. <br>

        I still havent fixed the slideshow. I am not really sure why it's blocking the top. I might try to play around with the css styling, I don't think it has any yet.

        </strong> April 23th, 2021 <br><br>
        I am continuing with the codecademy Javascript course. It can be a bit tedious at times, with long explainations for simple commands. Also, the lessons have lots of parts, some of which can be a bit repetitive. <br><br>
        I want to continue with data visualisaion (like my covid tracker from last year) and I found some interesting public NASA APIs that I might want to use to create an interacive space model. I wanted users to be able to zoom in and out and click on different objects with their fun facts. But before that starts I am going to make a JSON to CSV and CSV to JSON converting program because it will help me learn more about sorting data, and refresh my memory.

        </strong> May 3rd, 2021 <br><br>
        I am very excited. I have finally thought of a satisfactory project. I am going to make a texting app in which the user first selects a catagory and then the app provides them with information on that catagory. It is going to start small, with Covid 19 data. (I realized that I wasn't quite done with covid data). But once that section is completed, I want it to branch out into News, Weather, Food, Stocks & other useful information. Texting is so easy and sometimes all we want is basic information, so it would be nice to have all of that information in one place. Plus I'll get to use live data, so really this will be a happy combination of all my favorite things. I also want it to be simple. Clear numbers or short sentences. So information is assesible and speedy.

      <p> <strong> Journal 9: Teachback & Crypto <br>
        </strong> May 20th, 2021 <br><br>
        While I was tracking down the API and Keys I would need for my project, I found quite a few run by coinbase. There were so many, and with so much detail that I've chosen to focus on Crypo first. So I've been watch tutorials about how to implement their APIS. <br>

        Also, I finished my teachback about the orgins of programming, and it was super interesting to research. I was surprised to find out that teh first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace! A woman! It's interesting that CS is such a male-dominated field considering where it started.

      <p> <strong> Journal 10: CryptoTradingBot <br>
        </strong> May 23th, 2021 <br><br>
        OK! Things keep changing, but I've decided on my crypto trading bot. It uses the RSI indicator to determine whether or not to buy and sell. It also keeps track of price changes and basically serves as an automatic trader, so the user doesn't have to actively check themselves. Over the summer I would like to add more user interactivity because there is no User Interface at the moment. Also, BTC is the preset currency (though that can be changed in the code). <br>
        Now I am working on text and email reminders for when to buy and sell. Which, in the future, users will be able to select or deselect depening on whther they want automated trades or just the bot reccommendations. <br>
        The last aspect of the project would be to make it into a Web App, which I might do seperately and then connect after both are done.

        I finished adding the texting update, but I am having issues with Twilio. It is marked as delivered on their website but I didn't recieve a text. I tried multiple numbers and checked all my keys and tokens. I'm not sure what the issue could possibly be.

      <p> <strong> FINAL YEAR LONG SUMMARY <br>
        </strong> May 27th, 2021 <br><br>

        Presentation: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fmrNlEqNLTGqAmGh8NzffFjtbxfCP7LNbqIjEjWkA1Q/edit?usp=sharing">Year Long Project Summary</a>

        <br><br>
        <strong>First Semester: Switzerland</strong>

        <br><br>
        <strong>AP Computer Science (First Semester: Switzerland)</strong><br>
        I loved taking APCS. In some ways it seemed like going back to the basics, but while re-learning and learning concepts, I definetly came out of it with a greater understanding of Java. It especially changed the way I saw OOP because we delt so much with working modularly and building from the ground up. We did Lab assignments and LOTS of tests. It was also really interesting being in a different learning environment from Trevor. 

        <br><br>
        <strong>Second Semester: Trevor</strong>

        <br><br>
       <strong> My APW1 Webpage</strong><br>
        Summary:<br>
        A page about my progress during the year, and with jounral entries to track my progress. 

        <br><br>
        What I learned:<br>
        This defintely helped refresh my html and css. I hope to work more on JS in the future.

        <br><br>
        Future Goals:<br>
        So far I am happy with the way it looks, I just need to add more info onto my home page and upload my processing projects (maybe I should put those on the main page). I also would like to have the slides working, but the photos aren't showing up. And I would Like to add a button to return to the main page.

        <br><br>
        <strong>Project Outreach Website</strong><br>

        Summary:<br>
        A website I worked on mostly over the summer and edited second semester. It is for my club next year, Project Outreach

        Orginal Goals: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Relevant articles</li>
          <li>Community service options and info</li>
          <li>Fun main page</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Future Goals:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>More service options</li>
          <li>Search bar (still haven't figured that one out)</li>
          <li>Mobile app assesible (css for different sizes)</li>
        </ul>


        <br><br>
        <strong>CryptoTradingBot (Second Semester Project)</strong><br>
        Summary:<br>
        A python program that accesses the prices of a cryptocurrency and uses the RSI (Relative Strength Indicator) to recommend times to buy and sell. The program sends text reminders, but can also automatically buy and sell cryptocurrency of a certain amount in USD. It checks all the closing prices of each candlestick, and uses them to measure the RSI, once the RSI is below 30 or above 70, the program will act according ly(buying or selling). The program acts through binance, but sends SMS messages through twilio.

        Orginal Goals: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic trading with crypto</li>
          <li>Real live data</li>
          <li>User alerts</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Future Goals:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Connect to web app for user interface</li>
          <li>Offer email notifications</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Outcome:<br>
        I am happy with how this turned out. The texting aspect took longer than I expected, and though it's been resolved, I am not sure what the problem exactly was. I met the majority of my goals when heading into this project, but after creating the CryptoWebApp (because I wanted a visual side), I have new goals for a combined version. 

        <br><br>
        What I learned:<br>
        I learned about how candlestick charts work, with high, low, open, and closing prices. At first, I thought it was a bit confusing, but it makes a lot of sense for values that are constantly changing. I also learned about how  RSI works, and I hope to implement more theories into my program to make it more reliabley profitable. In addition, I learned more about collecting data and specifcally using the binance APIs.


        <br><br>
        <strong>CryptoWebApp (Second Semester Project)</strong><br>
        Summary:<br>
        Displays live candlestick data for crypto, and allows user to mannually buy. Displys user balances in Binance. 

        Orginal Goals: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Candle Stick Graphs</li>
          <li>Connection to specifc user account</li>
          <li>Buying and Selling</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Future Goals:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Connect to web app for user interface (as stated before)</li>
          <li>Have a button to switch displayed currency (now you have to type the symbol into the code</li>
          <li>Create an RSI graph to go along with th candle stick graph</li>
          <li>Display historical data</li>
          <li>Make check boxes responsive</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Outcome: <br>
        This piece of the project definetly needs more work, and I would love to have it work with my CryptoTradingBot. It was always supposed to display historical data, but for some reason, it will only display current data as of running the code. I am happy with the candle stickgraph.

        <br><br>
        What I learned:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>About how to use flask app</li>
          <li>Lightweight Charts</li>
        </ul>
